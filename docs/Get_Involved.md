#Get Involved!

Think we're incompetent site-runners? Have information that isn't on here? Have an awesome idea for a project?

Join us! Help us create the best resource possible for students, and maybe learn some new skills while doing it.

Hit us up on github for details, or email Erik @ eatillbe@lakeheadu.ca, or Francesco @ pcervell@lakeheadu.ca.

#Student Handbook

This is your primary resource. Here is information on the computer science program, its faculty, its classes, how to survive the tough ones, and plenty more. Thinking of entering computer science? You'll find plenty of information here on enrollment, what courses to register for, and tips on traversing Lakehead's website (e.g. avoid doing that).

##Introduction

Computer Science has grown into an incredibly broad topic - almost every field on earth now requires computer scientists in the workforce. Out of University, it is HARD to not find a job - it is a very in demand major.

So, what is computer science? Google tells me it's the "study of the principles and use of computers", but that's not a very good description. So here's what MTU says:

`Computer science is a discipline that spans theory and practice. It requires thinking both in abstract terms and in concrete terms. The practical side of computing can be seen everywhere. Nowadays, practically everyone is a computer user, and many people are even computer programmers. Getting computers to do what you want them to do requires intensive hands-on experience. But computer science can be seen on a higher level, as a science of problem solving. Computer scientists must be adept at modeling and analyzing problems. They must also be able to design solutions and verify that they are correct. Problem solving requires precision, creativity, and careful reasoning.
Computer science also has strong connections to other disciplines. Many problems in science, engineering, health care, business, and other areas can be solved effectively with computers, but finding a solution requires both computer science expertise and knowledge of the particular application domain. Thus, computer scientists often become proficient in other subjects.

Finally, computer science has a wide range of specialties. These include computer architecture, software systems, graphics, artifical intelligence, computational science, and software engineering. Drawing from a common core of computer science knowledge, each specialty area focuses on particular challenges.`

##Streams

At Lakehead University, there are two streams of computer science - business and science.

####Business
In the business stream, you'll be taking primarily business electives on top of your computer science course load. By doing this stream, you'll be provided a path to receiving the entrepreneurship certificate through the Faculty of Business

####Science
In the science stream, you'll be taking science electives (e.g. PHYS 10XX, CHEM 10XX). Which will give you plenty of the mathematics and logical thinking background you'll need to be a successful computer scientist.

##Game Programming Specializations
The Game Programming Specialization is an extra stamp on your degree that shows you took several courses that are extremely helpful (and I would say their content is mandatory) to any game programmer.

##CO-OP Program
As a computer science student, you can choose to take the co-op route. This involves taking a year off (usually your 4th year) and going to work for a company as a computer scientist. Lakehead really excels at getting these opportunities for students. Although they find great opportunities, you have to do the work, creating your resume, applying, filling out thousands of piles of paperwork, etc. Don't worry too much, there's a very helpful [co-op office](https://www.lakeheadu.ca/academics/other-programs/co-op) that will help you with everything. Just make sure you fill out the forms on time, the deadlines are often very early. By the way, many jobs are ONLY offered to co-op students because your wages are subsidized, so that should be incentive enough for you.

Lakehead has offered placements at:

* IBM
* RIM
* CIBC
* Cargill
* TBRRI

and many more...
